## Methodology

From the outset we used TRELLO to implement a Scrum method to approach the project. Once we agreed on a vision and main functionalities of the app, a user stories board was created to outline all the features required.
These were separated into 'Must-Have', 'Should-Have', 'Could-Have' and 'Won't-Have' so we could priorities stories.

Based on that, tasks were assigned to our Scrum development board. Great care was taken that everyone was clear on their tasks and that there were no blockers to halt the project. 
During our meetings, we assigned stories to each individual and in cases where stories were completed, that person was free to assign themselves to one from our user story board.
